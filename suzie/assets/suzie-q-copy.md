## All Your Sewing Needs.

The saloon's rough and tumble days of cross-stitching shoot-outs and beer-brawling basket-weaves are a distant memory.

Since the early aught's we've been a quaint, family-friendly establishment focused on the fundamentals of great sewing and crafts: fine thread, sharp needles, and hard liquor.
